# Kaggle-San-Francisco-Crime
This is my solution for the Kaggle challenge named "San Francisco Crime Classification" in R. 

<h2>Description of a problem</h2>
For 12 years all committed crimes in San Francisco were recorded. The information about crimes includes dates with precision to minutes, days of the week, name of the police department, address of street where the crime was committed, longitude (X), latitude (Y), resolution of crime, description of the crime, and category of crime. In total there are 9 features and one of them must be predicted. The dataset consists of 878,049 observations for training and 884,262 observations for testing. The testing data doesnâ€™t include the next list of features: category of crime, description of crime, resolution. 

The idea is to predict the type of commited crime by given time, adress and other information. The given train data consists of  878,000+ observations and test data has 884,000+ observations. So the optimizaton of code plays significat role

<b>Research question</b>: Is it possible to predict the category of crime by given time and location?

The project is constructed in next way. There are numbered scripts, starting from "0-Load-and-convert.R" and finishing with "6-Use-LogReg.R". The main Idea is to run them one by one and read the console output to get a feedback of what is happening.

<h3>Description of scripts</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"0-Load-and-convert.R". The script loads training and testing sets from dataset folder. It process them in a way that all strings will be replaced by numbers. The special field Data which showed information like "2015-05-13 23:53:00" was expanded to 4 different numerical fields - Year, Month, Day and Time where Time is a number of minutes in a Day   </li>
  <li>"1-Normalize.R". The script normalizes all features as all of them are numerical. They are scaled from 0 to 1</li>
  <li>"2-Apply-PCA.R". The script alalyses the features and provides a dimension reduction. It makes all plots important for explanation and visualisation</li>
  <li>"3-Use-KNN.R". The script uses built-in KNN model to make a predictions of test labels based on training samples</li>
  <li>"4-Use-SVM.R". The script uses built-in SVM model to train based on training dataset and then predict test labels</li>
  <li>"5-Use-DNN.R". The script uses TensorFlow 2 fully connected neural network to train based on training dataset and then predict test labels</li>
  <li>"6-Use-LogReg.R". The script shows implementation of a logistic regression based on pure math and theory. The model trains based on training dataset and then predicts test labels</li>
</ul>

<h3>Description of folders</h3>
<ul>
  <li> data/dataset. The place for train and testing datasets. Also includes example of submission for to Kaggle competition</li>
  <li> data/output. The folder keeps any output data produced by scripts. It could be csv tables or figures</li>
  <li> data/output/PCA. The folder keeps figures used for explanation of PCA processes</li>
</ul>
